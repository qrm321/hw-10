<h1>Where are park visitors most likely to influence and impact the waterways of Great Smoky Mountain National Park? </h1>
<h2>Quentin McCalla</h2>
<h3>This map shows the intersection of trails and waterways in GSMNP. This is useful because the majority of human caused damages will be 
    concentrated on or near trails.
</h3>
<h4> Procedures
</h4>
</h5>
    1. I created a 25 meter buffer around trails in the park. This is because I figured that most human caused disturbances (trash, erosion etc) will be within that range of the trails.
<p></p>
2. I then created a 25 meter buffer around the waterways in the park. I did this because I think that any trash or human caused damages within this range
reasonably have the potential to harm the waterway. 
<p></p>
3. I took the intersection of the 2 buffers listed above. I interpret this area as the area where humans are most likely to come in contact with and have
the ability to alter the waterways in the park.
